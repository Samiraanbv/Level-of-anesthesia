## Monitoring Depth of Anesthesia with Entropy Features and Artificial Neural Network

This repository contains an implementation of the paper titled "Monitoring the depth of anesthesia using entropy features and an artificial neural network". The paper addresses the challenge of monitoring anesthesia depth using electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. The proposed method consists of two steps: extracting entropy features from the EEG signal and utilizing an artificial neural network for depth assessment.
## Background

Monitoring the depth of anesthesia using an EEG is a complex task for anesthetists. The EEG provides valuable information about the different physiological states of the brain. This study introduces a novel automated method for assessing anesthesia depth. Sample entropy and permutation entropy features are extracted from the EEG signal, quantifying complexity and irregularity. These features are computationally efficient, conceptually simple, and resistant to artifacts. The extracted features are then fed into an artificial neural network, inspired by the biological nervous system, for further processing.
## Implementation

To use this implementation, follow the steps below:

    1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
    2. Install the necessary dependencies specified in the 'requirements.txt' file.
    3. Prepare the EEG dataset containing recordings of various anesthesia states.
    4. Utilize the provided scripts or notebooks to preprocess the EEG signals and extract sample entropy and permutation entropy features.
    5. Configure and train the artificial neural network using the extracted features as input.
    6. Evaluate the performance of the implemented system by measuring classification accuracy and other relevant metrics.
    7. Customize and fine-tune the system to suit your specific requirements and datasets.

Please refer to the documentation and code comments for detailed instructions on using the implementation effectively.
## Results

The experimental results presented in the paper demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed method in assessing anesthesia depth. During sevoflurane anesthesia, the system achieved an overall accuracy of 88% in classifying EEG data into awake, light, general, and deep anesthetized states across 17 patients. Additionally, when applied to an independent database of propofol and desflurane anesthesia across 129 patients, the method achieved a classification accuracy of 92.4% in distinguishing between awake and general anesthesia. These results highlight the potential of this method in providing rapid and accurate estimations of anesthesia depth.
